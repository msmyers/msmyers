### Hi thereâ€ƒðŸ‘‹â€ƒI do startups.
 
 I'm a full-stack [Entrepreneur](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-smyers).
  
 I've cofounded a few companies, the first of two _industries_.

   * **[Zipwhip](https://www.zipwhip.com)** - _"We help people text you."_
   
   * **[Coinme](https://www.coinme.com)** - _"We help people like you get Bitcoin."_
   
   * **[EvoEco](https://www.evoeco.com)** - _"We help people see the good in which they choose."_

   * **[b-street.build](https://b-street.build)** - _"We're building blockchain things."_
 
 ðŸ”­ ðŸ¤”â€ƒMission, Family, Self, Partner, Team, Tribe, World.â€ƒðŸŒ±

I believe in ground truth, shared goals, big vision, fast hacks, less features, build automation, and trying it out.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [b-street.build](https://b-street.build)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on the web3 stack _(Solidity, Hardhat, Forge, React, ethers, etc)._
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at `michael@b-street.build`

20 years of experience coding projects, building teams, solving problems, and building companies focused on helping people. A hybrid between Entrepreneur, Executive, and Engineer, as appropriate, with a proven track record of delivering successful products/companies at a high level - and coding cool stuff at the low level.

I'm passionate about working on meaningful things and have had the good fortune of working with some incredible people. **I love helping teams get it.**
