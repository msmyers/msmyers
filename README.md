### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I do startups.

 - I'm a full-stack Entrepreneur - strategy, product, engineering - and am the shoulder/step-in of last resort.
 
 - I've cofounded [Zipwhip](https://www.zipwhip.com), [Coinme](https://www.coinme.com) - creating two industries.

 - I grew up on 1990s-era BBS.
 
As an ENTP, I thrive on seeing a future & inspiring it into the present.
