### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I do startups.

 - I'm a full-stack entrepreneur - strategy, product, engineering.
 
 - I've cofounded [Zipwhip](https://www.zipwhip.com), [Coinme](https://www.coinme.com) - creating two industries.

 - âš¡ **I design my life around 5x5 _(Five years & Five tries)_** - The sweet spot between impact vs opportunity cost.

As an ENTP, I thrive on seeing a future & pulling it into the present.
