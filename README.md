### Hi thereâ€ƒðŸ‘‹â€ƒI do startups.
 
 I'm a full-stack Entrepreneur. 
  
 I've cofounded a few companies, the first of two _industries_.

   * **[Zipwhip](https://www.zipwhip.com)** - _"We help people text you."_
   
   * **[Coinme](https://www.coinme.com)** - _"We help people like you get Bitcoin."_
   
   * **[EvoEco](https://www.evoeco.com)** - _"We help people see the good in which they choose."_
 
 ðŸ”­ ðŸ¤”â€ƒMission, Family, Self, Partner, Team, Tribe, World.â€ƒðŸŒ±

I believe in ground truth, shared goals, big vision, fast hacks, less features, and trying it out.

20 years experience coding projects, building teams, and companies focused on helping people. Hybrid between Entrepreneur, Executive, and Engineer, as appropriate, with a proven track record of delivering successful products/companies at the high level - and coding stuff at the low level.
