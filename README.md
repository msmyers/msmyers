20 years of experience coding projects, building teams, solving problems, and building companies focused on helping people. A hybrid between Entrepreneur, Executive, and Engineer, as appropriate, with a proven track record of delivering successful products/companies at a high level - and coding cool stuff at the low level.

I'm passionate about working on meaningful things and have had the good fortune of working with some incredible people. **I love helping us get it.**
