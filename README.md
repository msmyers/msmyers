### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I do startups.
 
 - I'm a full-stack Entrepreneur - business strategy, product, design, marketing, engineering, salesforce.
 
 - I've cofounded a few companies, and have first-mover/started two _industries_.

   * **[Zipwhip](https://www.zipwhip.com)** - _"Your customers want to text, let them."_
   
   * **[Coinme](https://www.coinme.com)** - _"We help people like you get Bitcoin"_
   
   * **[EvoEco](https://www.evoeco.com)** - _"We help people see the good in what they choose."_
 
As an ENTP, I thrive on dreams of a future, and work on bringing them into the present.

 * My passion is software.
 
 * I would rather win than be right, or lose because I was wrong instead of not enough.
 
 * I work on 1 idea at a time, calibrate to 5y/ea, battle in the deep blue sea, and avoid the bloody red ocean. 
  
Fundamental shifts in humanity create true opportunity - The industry has poor aim, but moves _very very quickly_.

 * If you believe in the same, reach out and let's dance on something.
